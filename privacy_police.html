                         <strong><em><u>Cookies</u></em></strong><u>:</u>&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data stored locally in the temporary memory of your web browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to provide our services and understand our users.
                         <ul>
                            <li>Cookies distinguish you from other visitors to <a href="index.html">www.fijipools.com</a>. We use cookies in this way to enhance or customize a Person’s visit to the Website and to recognize that Person when he or she visits again. This makes the Website easier and faster for you to use while providing us with useful information about your use of the Website.</li>
                            <li>If you have concerns about the use of cookies, you can always act to prevent their activation and use, for example by changing the privacy settings in the browser that you use to access the Website. Because computer software and hardware is unique, your ability to manage cookies may require detailed steps that are not practical to explain here. Refusing or deleting cookies will limit the information that we can collect and store, and may also limit the ability to take advantage of some features of the Website.</li>
                         </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong><em><u>Online advertising (including, but not limited to, video, social, and native advertising)</u></em></strong><u>:</u> Online advertising will be used to advertise Fiji Pools products.&nbsp;We will track the number of clicks on ads for analytical and marketing purposes.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li><strong><em><u>Pixel Tags:</u></em>&nbsp;</strong>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</li>
                      <li><strong><em><u>Browser Web Storage:</u></em>&nbsp;</strong>Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in “local storage” mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.</li>
                      <li><strong><em><u>Application Data Cache:</u></em>&nbsp;</strong>An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.</li>
                      <li><strong><em><u>Server Logs:</u></em></strong>&nbsp;Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>

                   <p><strong>VII. Additional policy considerations</strong></p>
                   <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to protect Personal Information and privacy rights as they are currently understood, and to satisfy applicable rules and regulations. The text of this Privacy Policy cannot address every potential issue and circumstance.

This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time in accordance with applicable laws and evolving business needs. This Policy will be available on the Website and other relevant public interfaces.</p>
                   <p>California law entitles California residents to request additional information about what personally identifiable information a company shares with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing efforts. The Fiji Pools does not share your information with third parties for the third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. The Fiji Pools will allow each California resident to make one request per calendar year. California law also requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time. &nbsp;If you have questions about our practices or your rights under California law, please write to us at Fiji Pools Privacy Policy c/o General Counsel, 1302 N. Meridian St., Indianapolis, IN 46202.</p>
